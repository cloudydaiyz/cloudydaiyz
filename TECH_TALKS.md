# Tech Talks 🖥

I believe that spreading knowledge any way you can encourages a healthy future for software engineering. Tech Talks are a way for me to accomplish this by sharing information that, while may not be as promoted, is still highly valuable.

This repository contains a list of all the tech talks that I've led.
